# Exploring-Planets
Our first glimpse at planets outside of the solar system we call home came in 1992 when several terrestrial-mass planets were detected orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12. In this dataset, you can become a space explorer too by analyzing the characteristics of all discovered exoplanets (plus some familiar faces like Mars, Saturn, and even Earth). Data fields include planet and host star attributes, discovery methods, and (of course) date of discovery.
Data was originally collected and continues to be updated by Hanno Rein at the Open Exoplanet Catalogue Github repository. If you discover any new exoplanets, please submit a pull request there.
